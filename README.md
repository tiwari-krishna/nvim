# NeoVim

My personal **NeoVim** configuration BTW.

Just clone it and enjoy the neovim Journey.

## Overview

Just another NeoVim config with LSP, formatters, and few other QoL improvements.
For further docs, just look at the code.

## Things that I have

- LSP : Using mason to install lsps and formatters
- Package Manager : using the native neovim package manager (needs neovim 0.12 or later)
- other essential things as plugins and some just as lua scripts
